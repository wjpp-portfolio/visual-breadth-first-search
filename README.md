# visual-breadth-first-search
A python bfs algorithm demonstrated in a user-created maze

This program first requires you to draw a maze and set a start and end location for the search.  The program will then highlight the route from the start to end.

## controls
Use **arrowkeys** to place a node (square) on the grid.  Valid routes between nodes are indicated by a thin edge (line).

press **d** to delete a node and all edges

press **e** to place an end marker which is where the algorithm will attempt to location

press **s** to place a start marker which is where the algorithm will search from

press **space** to 'lift' the drawing pen from the page to navigate without drawing nodes.  press space again to start drawing again

press **return** (enter) to start the breadth first search algorithm

press **r** to reset the entire grid
